Cobb is an optimised object-oriented command-line entry management application that aims to make database management for Real Estate Agents easier and more accessible.

It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, Cobb can carry out functionality much faster than other traditional database management software can!

Cobb can also run on any machine, *without the need for an internet connection*.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* The first word in the command string actually specifies which command we are invoking. For example, `help` specifies that we are invoking the `help` command, while `adduser -n John Doe` specifies that we are using the `adduser` command.


* Items in square brackets are parameters that must be passed into the command.<br>
  e.g. `[-n NAME]` indicates that the command requires a `NAME` parameter to be passed in.


* Parameters that contain angled braces `<>` means that the valid values that a parameter can take must be one of the values within the braces.<br>
  e.g. `-r <s, b>` means that the `r` parameter can take values `s` or `b`.


* Parameters that contain curly braces `{}` means that the parameters are optional, and can be excluded from the command if not required.<br>
  For an example, `{-c CHARACTERISTICS}` means that the `CHARACTERISTICS` parameter is optional.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `[-n NAME] [-p PHONE_NUMBER]`, `[-p PHONE_NUMBER] [-n NAME]` is also acceptable.


* To specify a parameter and the value that it will take, type the parameter's flag followed by a space, and then its value.<br>
  e.g `-n John Doe` will define the parameter `name` to store the value `John Doe`.


* If commands are missing specific parameters required for it to execute, an error message will be displayed that contains information about the syntax of the command and its required parameters.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Note that Cobb's `update` and `find` queries searches for entries that have a specified name. In the event of multiple matches, all matching entries will be displayed on the screen for you to view.
</div>


</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Displays a helpful list of commands and their related syntax for the user to refer to.

Format: `help`


### Adding a buyer to the database: `addbuyer`

Adds a user to the database, with a tag to specify whether the user is a buyer or seller, or both.<br>
Syntax: `addbuyer [-n NAME] [-ph PHONE]] [-e EMAIL] [-a address] {-r PRICE RANGE} {-c CHARACTERISTICS}}`

The `-n` flag indicates the name of the buyer.<br>
The `-ph` flag indicates the buyer’s phone number.<br>
The `-e` flag indicates the buyer’s email.<br>
The `-a` flag indicates the buyer’s house address.<br>
The `-r` flag indicates the price range of properties that the buyer can accept.<br>
The `-c` flag indicates the characteristics that the buyer is looking for in a property.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The range field and the characteristics field are optional.
That is, it is perfectly okay to initialise a buyer that does not have these fields.
</div>

Examples:<br>
`addbuyer -n Tim -ph 87321237 -e tim@gmail.com -a S648234` : Adds a buyer named Tim to the database.<br>
`addbuyer -n Jane -ph 89991237 -e jane@gmail.com -a S123456 -r 10000-500000 -c bright; sunny` : Adds a buyer named Jane to the database.
Ideally, Jane would like a property that costs between $10000 - $500000, and has characteristics "bright" and "sunny".

### Adding a property to the database: `addprop`

Adds a property to the database along with relevant information.<br>
Syntax: `addprop [-n NAME] [-price PRICE] [-a ADDRESS] [-d DESCRIPTION] {-c CHARACTERISTICS} [-owner OWNER NAME] [-p PHONE]`

The `-n` flag indicates the name of the property.<br>
The `-price` flag indicates the property’s price.<br>
The `-a` flag indicates the property’s address.<br>
The `-d` flag indicates the property’s description (characteristics).<br>
The `-c` flag indicates the characteristics associated with the property.<br>
The `-owner` flag indicates the name of the owner of the property.<br>
The `-p` flag indicates the phone number of the owner of the property.<br>

Examples: <br>
`addprop -n Peak Residences -a 333 Thompson Road -price 1000000 -d long long long property description -owner Bob -p 91234567`: Adds a property called "Peak Residences" to the database along with its relevant description.
The property is owned by Bob with a phone number of 91234567.

### Deleting buyers from the database: `deletebuyer`

Syntax: `deletebuyer INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:exclamation: **Note:**
Note that this command has a slightly different syntax from the usual commands, as it takes a number representing the index of the object that you would like to delete
instead of flags like other commands.
</div>

The `INDEX` specified in this command refers to the index of the entry that is currently visible on the list.
Note that if an entry has been filtered out / is not currently on the list, then a `deletebuyer` command cannot be executed on it.

Examples:<br>
`deletebuyer 5`: Deletes the fifth buyer currently visible on the buyer list.

### Deleting properties from the database: `deleteprop`

Syntax: `deleteprop INDEX`

The `INDEX` specified in this command refers to the index of the entry that is currently visible on the list.
Note that if an entry has been filtered out / is not currently on the list, then a `deleteprop` command cannot be executed on it.

Examples:<br>
`deleteprop 5`: Deletes the fifth property currently visible on the property list.

### Update a property entry in database: `editprop`

Syntax: `editprop INDEX {-n NAME} {-price PRICE} {-a ADDRESS} {-d DESCRIPTION} {-c CHARACTERISTICS} {-owner OWNERNAME} {-p PHONE}`

Updates a property’s details with specified information in specified categories.

The `INDEX` indicates which property in the list we are choosing to update.
The `-n` flag indicates the property's new name.<br>
The `-p` flag indicates the property’s new price.<br>
The `-a` flag indicates the property’s new address.<br>
The `-d` flag indicates the property’s new description.<br>
The `-c` flag indicates the property's new characteristics.<br>
The `-owner` flag indicates the property's owner's new name.<br>
The `-p` flag indicates the property's owner's new phone number.<br>

Note that we are updating existing entries in the database, hence all parameters above are optional,
as we can choose to update a parameter without changing the others. Also, the `INDEX` field specifies the index of the property that we want to update
on the current visible property list, so if the property is not on this list, then we cannot execute this command on the property.

Examples:<br>
`editprop 3 -n Hill Residence -a Block 225 -p 750000`: Updates property at index 3 of the list to have a new name Hill Residence, a new address Block 225 and price 750000.

### Update a buyer entry in the database: `editbuyer`

Syntax: `editbuyer INDEX {-n NAME} {-p PHONE} {-e EMAIL} {-a ADDRESS} {-r PRICERANGE} {-c CHARACTERISTICS} {-priority PRIORITY<HIGH, NORMAL, LOW>}`

The `-p` flag indicates the buyer's new phone number.<br>
The `-e` flag indicates the buyer's new email address.<br>
The `-a` flag indicates the buyer's new address.<br>
The `-r` flag indicates the buyer's new acceptable price range.<br>
The `-c` flag indicates the buyer's new desired property characteristics.<br>
The `-priority` flag indicates the buyer's new priority - Priority values must be one of `HIGH, NORMAL, LOW`.

Note that we are updating existing entries in the database, hence all parameters above are optional,
as we can choose to update a parameter without changing the others. Also, the `INDEX` field specifies the index of the buyer that we want to update
on the current visible buyer list, so if the buyer is not on this list, then we cannot execute this command on the buyer.

Examples:<br>
`editbuyer 3 -n John Doe -e johndoe@yahoo.com -r 40000-50000 -priority HIGH`: Updates buyer at index 3 to have a new name "John Doe", new email "johndoe@yahoo.com", new acceptable price range of $40000 - $500000, and a high priority.
`editbuyer 1 -c bright; sunny`: Updates buyer at index 1 to have new desired characteristics of bright and sunny.

### Find buyer entry in database: `findbuyer`
Syntax: `findbuyer [-k KEYWORDS]`

Searches through the database and returns all buyers whose names contain any keywords in KEYWORDS _(case-insensitive)_.

The `-p` flag indicates that we will be filtering buyers that have a price range containing the specified price.
The `-c` flag indicates that we will be filtering buyers that want properties with some (or all) of the specified ";"-separated characteristics.
The `-priority` flag indicates that we will be filtering buyers according to the specified priority level.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Cobb home folder.
Alternatively, copy and paste the data file with the *same name* from your old computer.

**Q**: Help! I can't seem to get a command to work...<br>
**A**: Take a look at the command info above! Make sure that you have supplied all necessary parameters and specified parameter flags in a correct manner (`-` for short, `--` for full).

**Q**: How do I run the app if double-clicking the jar file does nothing? <br>
**A**: First, make sure that you have Java `11` or above installed. For the more technically inclined, run this command in the jar file's home directory: `java -jar cobb.jar`<br>
If the problem persists, report the bug to us!

**Q**: I deleted my data file! Is there any way to recover the data that I lost?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, there is no way for you to recover your data after you have deleted it. However, we are working on a way to make data persist in the future, so stay tuned!

**Q**: How do I uninstall Cobb? <br>
**A**: We are sad to see you go :( Cobb is not installed onto your hard drive, so you only need to delete the `cobb.jar` file as well as any associated data files.
