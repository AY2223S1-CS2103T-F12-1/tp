## **Introduction**

Cobb is a brownfield software project based off of [AddressBook3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/). It is a 
JavaFX application that helps property agents manage their database of buyers and properties using a command-line interface.

### **Purpose**

This guide is primarily targeted towards developers looking to understand or extend the functionalities of Cobb, 
and software testers looking to test Cobb's features. You are also welcome to read this if you understand UML diagrams
and have a general understanding of how a software application works under the hood.

### **Scope**

This guide first gives a high-level architecture overview of Cobb, before explaining the main components that make up 
the application. It then explains some notable features and the design considerations behind their implementation. To
better understand what the application does from the user's standpoint, you might want to dive into the 
[Use cases](#Use cases) section first, or simply run the application and try it for yourself before reading the rest 
of the guide.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called 
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `deletebuyer 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API 
* `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality 
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given 
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled 
to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API**: 
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BuyerListPanel`, `PropertyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Buyer` and `Property` objects residing in `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : 
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CobbParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddBuyerCommand`) 
which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a buyer).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletebuyer 1")` 
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletebuyer 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteBuyerCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CobbParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
placeholder for the specific command name e.g. `AddBuyerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to 
parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g. `AddBuyerCommand`) which the `CobbParser` returns back 
as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `AddBuyerCommandParser`, `DeletePropertyCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the 
`Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g. during testing.

### Model component
**API** : 
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="950" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the buyer book data i.e., all `Buyer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueBuyerList` object).
* stores the property book data i.e, all `Property` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePropertyList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Buyer` and `Property` objects (e.g. results of a search query) as separate
_filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Buyer>` and `ObservableList<Property>`
respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when 
the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a 
`ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they 
should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) 
model is given below. A generic Cobb class is created as the parent for BuyerBook and PropertyBook since the two 
children classes have a lot of methods with identical purposes.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="850" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save buyer book data, property book data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into 
corresponding objects.
* inherits from `BuyerBookStorage`, `PropertyBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either 
one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects 
that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th buyer in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new buyer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the buyer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the buyer being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Navigate previous commands with arrow keys

#### Motivation

Currently, once a command is executed successfully, there is no way for the user to get it back easily.
However, a user who frequently uses command line interfaces (CLIs) might expect the use of arrow keys to bring
back previous commands, as a way to quickly input multiple similar commands at once.

#### Implementation
`CommandBox` in the `commandbox` package represents the GUI component where the user enters commands.
`CommandRetriever` is a static nested class within `CommandBox`, used to contain and retrieve the history of
successful commands. It implements the following public methods:
- `CommandRetriever#addCommand(String command, TextField textfield)` - Adds a successful command to the command history,
and clears the TextField
- `CommandRetriever#getPreviousCommand(TextField textfield)` - Displays the previous command in the Textfield, if it
exists in the history
- `CommandRetriever#getNextCommand(TextField textfield)` - Displays the next command in the Textfield, if it
exists in the history

These methods are called by `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` and `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased(KeyEvent e)`.

Here is the UML diagram for `CommandRetriever`.

![CommandRetrieverClassDiagram](images/CommandRetrieverClassDiagram.png)

`CommandRetriever` only keeps track of the commands executed successfully, as invalid commands are highlighted red
and do not disappear from the TextField. Thus, there is no need to store these invalid commands since the user can
already edit the invalid command in the current implementation without having to retype it. Storing invalid commands
in `CommandRetriever` would only clutter up the history, especially if the user inputted numerous invalid commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the arrow key changes the `CommandBox` text field at each step.
A sequence diagram is also provided below.

![CommandRetrieverSequenceDiagram](images/CommandRetrieverSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `commandHistory` is initialised as an empty
`ArrayList<String>`, and index is initialised as 0.

Step 2. The user executes a command, `listbuyers` by pressing the Enter key. `CommandBox#handleCommand` is fired,
getting the text from the text field. Since it is a valid command, it is executed successfully. `listbuyers` is added
to the `commandHistory` list, and index is set to `commandHistory.size()`.

Step 3. The user types a command halfway, but does not press the Enter key. He/she now wishes to use the previous
command to type the command.

Step 4. The user presses and releases the Up arrow. `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased` is fired, which sets the text field
to display the `(index - 1)`th element in `commmandHistory`. Because the current command is one that has not been
executed, it is saved in the field `currentCommand`.

Step 5. The user presses and releases the Up arrow again. `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased` is fired, but since there are
no more previous commands, nothing happens.

Step 6. The user presses and releases the Down arrow. `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased` is fired. Since this is the last
element in `commandHistory`, the text field is set to display the string `currentCommand`. This would be the user's
unexecuted command from Step 3.

### Indexing existing buyers and properties in the database

Many of the existing features that are currently implemented requires Cobb to index existing entries in the database.
For example, `deletebuyer 1` would perform the `deletebuyer` operation on the buyer at index `1` of the buyer list.

If the index provided is not a positive integer or not a valid number, Cobb will throw an error requesting the user to
provide a valid input. Similarly, if the index provided is valid but exceeds the number of elements currently in the list,
Cobb will be able to identify that there is a bounds mismatch and inform the user to provide a valid input within bounds.

Internally, both of the lists of `Buyers` and `Properties` are stored using an `ObservableArrayList`, which is an array-like
data structure provided by JavaFX which fires off reports about all of its changes to associated listeners. This means that
any changes to the structure or objects in the `ObservableArrayList` will be recorded by its listeners, causing the updated
list to be displayed correctly on the user's screen.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How entries are indexed in a list**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Entries are indexed by their relative positions in the current `ObservableArrayList`.
  If the list is filtered or sorted, then the entries' relative positions will change according to this new version of the
  list.
    * Pros:
        * Users will be able to quickly ascertain the index of an entry in the list simply by finding the entry in the list.
        * Indices of visible entries in the `ObservableArrayList` will always be in the range `[1,n]` inclusive, where n
          is the number of entries currently visible in the list. This gives the indices order and structure.
        * No index field needs to be created for `Buyer` and `Property` objects.
    * Cons:
        * The relative index of an entry will change depending on the current structure of the `ObservableArrayList`. This 
          means that a property that has index `1` might not have the same index after the property list is filtered.

* **Alternative 2**: Entries in a list are indexed by an internal `EntryID` parameter that is automatically generated 
  upon its creation.
    * Pros:
        * Users will still be able to identify the index of the entry by first looking for the entry in the list, and then
          looking at the value of its `EntryID` parameter.
        * The index of the entry in the list will not change if the structure of the list is changed, e.g. through filtering
          or sorting operations.
    * Cons:
        * `Buyer` and `Property` class will be bloated with one extra parameter.
        * Care needs to be taken to ensure that no IDs are clashing with each other, which might lead to implementation issues.
        * Users might be able to execute commands on entries in the list that are not currently visible, which might lead
          to confusion.

### Internal implementations of Buyers and Properties

Cobb allows functionality that performs operations on two distinct types of entities stored in the database: Potential property
buyers, as well as properties that are for sale. To allow for this functionality, two classes were created that represented each type
of entity: `Buyer` and `Property`, respectively.

The structure of a `Buyer` object can be viewed in the class diagram below.

![BuyerClassDiagram](images/BuyerClassDiagram.png)

From the diagram, it can be seen that a `Buyer` object consists of the following attributes:
- A `Name`, representing the name of the buyer.
- A `Phone`, representing the phone number of the buyer.
- An `Address`, representing the address of the buyer.
- An `Email`, representing the email address of the buyer.
- An `entryTime`, representing the creation time of the buyer (created and accessed internally).
- A `Priority`, representing the priority of the buyer - High, Normal or Low.
- A `PriceRange`, representing the price range of properties that a buyer is willing to consider.
- A `Characteristics`, representing the characteristics of a property that a buyer is looking for.

On the other hand, the structure of a `Property` object can be viewed in the class diagram below.

![PropertyClassDiagram](images/PropertyClassDiagramNew.png)

From the diagram, it can be seen that a `Property` object consists of the following attributes:
- A `PropertyName`, representing the name of the property.
- An `Address`, representing the address of the property.
- A `Description`, representing a short description of the property.
- An `Owner`, representing the Owner of the property. An owner has an `ownerName` and an `ownerPhone`.
- A `propertyEntryTime`, representing the creation time of the property (created and accessed internally).
- A `Price`, representing the price of the property.
- A `Characteristics`, representing the characteristics that a property possesses.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `Buyer` and `Property` objects are stored internally**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Individual classes are created for each of the attributes related to `Buyer` and `Property`
  objects.
  * Pros:
    * Reduces piling up of functionality within the `Buyer` and `Property` classes by abstracting out behaviour related to each
      individual attribute to its own component class.
    * Adheres more to the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
      through aforementioned abstraction of functionality.
    * Makes the code neater and easier to follow.
    * Makes individual components of code easier to test and easier to re-use.
  * Cons:
    * Increases coupling of different classes.
    * Increases the number of classes in the codebase.
    
  
* **Alternative 2**: All individual attributes are stored directly in the `Property` or `Buyer` classes, with all related
  functionality also implemented within them. This would result in `Buyer` and `Property` objects similar to that in the 
  UML diagram below.
  * Pros:
    * No extra classes are required, as all attributes are stored directly in the component classes.
    * All functionality is executed by the singular component class, so there is no confusion.
  * Cons:
    * Very bloated component classes with a lot of functionality.
    * Difficult to abstract and test each functionality of the class separately.


![Alternative Property and Buyer implementation](images/AlternativeBuyerAndProperty.png)


### Creating a buyer

The `Buyer` class represents a buyer with buyer-specific fields. `PriceRange`, `Characteristics`, and `Priority`
denote his budget, requirements for the property, and buyer priority respectively.  

These three fields are all optional. When the user chooses not to indicate a buyer’s price range or desired characteristics, the `priceRange` and `desiredCharacteristics` field of a buyer may be null. Hence, they have both been implemented using `Optional<T>`.
When the user chooses not to indicate a buyer priority, the buyer's priority will be set to the default priority as `NORMAL`.
When the user creates a buyer, the time of creation is also automatically stored as a `LocalDateTime`.

The structure for executing an `addbuyer` command follows the flow as mentioned in the “Logic component” section of this guide.

#### Design considerations:
Duplicate buyers should not be able to be added into the buyer list. This means that we need some sort of criterion to differentiate
between buyers.

Originally, we disallowed creation of two buyers that have the same name. However, we found this to be too rigid as there could very well
exist two distinct buyers that have the same name. Instead, we decided to make use of phone numbers and emails to identify identical buyers,
as these fields should be unique to each person.

The time of creation field was added towards the later part of development to help facilitate a more flexible implementation of the `sortbuyers` command.  

The activity diagram for the creation of a buyer can be seen below.

![Add buyer activity diagram](images/AddBuyerActivityDiagram.png)

### Creating a property

The `Property` class represents a property with property-specific fields. `Price` and `Characteristics` denote the price and feature of the property respectively.

The `price` field is mandatory while the `characteristics` field is optional. When the user chooses not to indicate a property's characteristics, the `characteristics` field of a property may be null. Hence, it has been implemented using `Optional<T>`.
When the user creates a property, the time of creation is also automatically stored as a `LocalDateTime`.

The structure for executing an `addprop` command follows the flow as mentioned in the "Logic component" section of this guide.

#### Design considerations:
No duplicate properties can be added to the property list. This means that we need some sort of criterion to differentiate between
properties.

Originally, we disallowed creation of two properties that have the same name and price. However, we found this to be to rigid as
there could very well be two distinct properties that exist which have both the same name and price. Instead, we decided to make
use of the property's address to distinguish it from another property, as the address of a property should be unique to it.

The time of creation field was added towards the later part of development to help facilitate a more flexible implementation of the `sortprops` command.

The activity diagram for the creation of a property can be seen below.

![Add property activity diagram](images/AddPropertyActivityDiagram.png)

### Owner specification within a property
To identify the owner of the property, we decided to include an `Owner` object within a `Property`. This `Owner` class contains two fields: `name` and `phone`.

The `name` and `phone` fields in the `Owner` class are compulsory, to make sure that each property being sold has a relevant contact buyer.
The fields are also validated the same way as when creating a new `Buyer` object.

To support retrieving the `Owner` of a `Property`, we added the following methods:
- `Property#getOwner()` - Returns the `Owner` object of the property.
- `Property#getOwnerName()` - Retrieves the name of the owner of the property.
- `Property#getOwnerPhone()` - Retrieves the phone number of the owner of the property.

This is the class diagram showing the full `Property` class diagram, with the `Owner` class included:
![FullPropertyClassDiagram](images/OwnerClassDiagram.png)

The `Owner` class enacts the Composition relationship, as the `Property` class contains the `Owner` object. Hence, if the property is deleted, it's associated owner will also be deleted.
The tradeoffs for this approach is examined below:

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the owner class associates with the property class**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Owner class is coupled together with the property class.
    * Pros:
      * The `Owner` class is only used in the `Property` class, so it makes sense to couple them together.
      * You do not need to create an owner object separately using another command.
      * This reduces complexity of the system, and unexpected behaviours.
    * Cons:
      * This creates a 1-to-1 relationship between the owner and the property.
      * Each owner is coupled tightly with the property, and cannot be used for other properties.

* **Alternative 2:** Users will have to create an `Owner` object separately, and link it to the property manually.
    * Pros:
      * This allows for a many-to-many relationship between the owners and properties.
      * This allows for better OOP design, as owners will be treated as a separate, first-class entity, similar to
      `Buyer`.
    * Cons:
      * Increases complexity for a possibly limited use case of linking an owner to multiple properties.
      * This may lead to unexpected behaviours, such as whether properties linked to an owner should be deleted when
      the owner is deleted.

### Filtering buyers and properties: Overall structure

In order to filter `Buyers` and `Properties`, a `Predicate` needs to be passed into the `ObservableArrayList` that stores 
references to these objects and displays them on the user's screen. These predicates can differ in the conditions that are
being tested, consequently, they might give different outputs when applied to a given list.

#### Design Considerations
In order to allow for multiple-condition filtering, that is, the concatenation of multiple filter predicates, an abstract 
`AbstractFilterXYZPredicate` class was created to employ polymorphic behaviour, where XYZ represents the entity type that
we are working with, for example `AbstractFilterBuyersPredicate` or `AbstractFilterPropsPredicate`. 

Additionally, since users
are only allowed to filter using certain conditions as defined in the behaviour of the `filter` commands, concrete classes
extending this abstract predicate class were implemented for each condition. For example:

Users can filter `Properties` by their `PropertyName`, `Price`, `Characteristics` or `OwnerName`. As a result, the following 
concrete predicate classes were implemented:
1. `PropertyNameContainsSubstringPredicate`
2. `FilterPropsByPricePredicate`
3. `FilterPropsContainingAllCharacteristicsPredicate`
4. `FilterPropsContainingAnyCharacteristicsPredicate`
5. `FilterPropsByOwnerNamePredicate`

Based on command parameters passed in by the user, these predicates are constructed and concatenated together to form a single
`Predicate`, which is then used to filter the `ObservableArrayList` directly. More specifics regarding concatenation behaviour
can be found in the [filter-specific design considerations](#filter-specific-design-considerations) section located below.

The below UML diagram represents the overall structure of the predicates for `Buyers` and `Properties`.

![FilterPredicatesClassDiagram](images/FilterPredicatesClassDiagram.png)

#### Filter-specific design considerations
1. Filtering `Properties` by their prices takes in a `priceRange` instead of just a `Price` as it makes more sense for
   agents to want to identify properties that fit within a certain price range instead of a fixed price.
2. For both `filterBuyers` and `filterProps`, the default concatenated predicate will be a logical **AND** of all individual
   predicates, that is, all predicates need to be satisfied in order for the entry to pass through the filter.
3. For both `filterBuyers` and `filterProps`, passing in the `-fuzzy` flag will change the final concatenated predicate to be
   a logical **OR** of all individual predicates, that is, only one of the predicates needs to be satisfied in order
   for the entry to pass through the filter.
4. If the `-c` flag is specified, that is, desired characteristics are supplied as filter conditions, the default behaviour
   is for Cobb to filter out entries that contain **ALL** of the given characteristics. The `-fuzzy` flag changes this behaviour
   to filter out entries that contain *at least one* of the given characteristics.
5. Filtering entries by name - that is, providing the `-n` flag to the filter command, will filter all entries whose names
   contain the parameter provided to `-n` as a *substring*.

### Matching properties to a buyer, and vice versa

`matchprop` and `matchbuyer` are convenience features, allowing the users to find suitable matches between buyers
and properties easily. Without this, users would have to manually input the conditions from an identified buyer or 
property and make use of the `filter` command. `matchprop` allows users to filter the buyer list with the conditions 
set by a specific property. `matchbuyer` is similar, filtering the property list with the conditions set by a specific 
buyer. 

#### Specifications

For `matchprop`, a `Buyer` is considered a match if its `PriceRange` contains the property's `Price` (inclusive),
and contains at least 1 common characteristic with the property.
For `matchbuyer`, a `Property` is considered a match if its `Price` is within the buyer's `PriceRange` (inclusive),
and contains at least 1 common characteristic with the buyer.

It is also possible to specify `-strict`, which would require a matching object to have _all_ (instead of at least 1)
the characteristics of the target object. This was added due to the possibility that the user gets too many matches,
and wishes to narrow down the results easily. Without this, the user would have to revert to the `filter` command 
and manually input more specific conditions.

Here is a Sequence Diagram of how `matchbuyer 1` is handled, assuming 1 is a valid index and the `Buyer` at index 1 
contains both a `PriceRange` and `Characteristics`.

![MatchBuyerSequenceDiagram](images/MatchBuyerCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

We see how `MatchBuyerCommand` only works to create a combined predicate of `PriceRange` and `Characteristic`, which is 
then passed to the constructor of `FilterPropertiesCommand` and executed.

#### Design considerations:

`Buyer` and `Property` have many different fields, but there were only a few common fields between them. Both classes
contain `Characteristics`. `Property` contains `Price`, which inherits from `PriceRange` that `Buyer` contains. Thus,
it makes sense that only these fields are used in the match commands, since it would not be possible to filter the list
by a field that is not present in a matching object.

Initially, we also considered allowing a `Buyer` or `Property` to be a match if it just contained at least 1 common
characteristic (i.e. a match did not need to satisfy the pricing condition). However, we decided against this as we
felt that a buyer would almost never consider a property that is not within their budget, and vice versa. Allowing this
to occur would likely give the user more matches that were irrelevant instead of useful ones.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* property agent
* needs to manage a significant number of buyers, sellers and properties concurrently
* often overwhelmed by a disorganised and inefficient database
* wants to keep track of all information neatly categorised in one place
* takes too long to manually go through each property to find one that matches a buyer's requirements
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: increases efficiency and convenience by allowing quick text-based inputs,
use of commands to quickly execute functionalities as compared to buttons in the UI on desktop applications, 
automation of matching between suitable properties and buyers
