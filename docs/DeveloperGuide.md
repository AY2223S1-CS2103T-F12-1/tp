### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a buyer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th buyer in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new buyer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the buyer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the buyer being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Navigate previous commands with arrow keys

#### Motivation

Currently, once a command is executed successfully, there is no way for the user to get it back easily. 
However, a user who frequently uses command line interfaces (CLIs) might expect the use of arrow keys to bring
back previous commands, as a way to quickly input multiple similar commands at once.

#### Implementation
`CommandBox` in the `commandbox` package represents the GUI component where the user enters commands.
`CommandRetriever` is a static nested class within `CommandBox`, used to contain and retrieve the history of 
successful commands. It implements the following public methods:
- `CommandRetriever#addCommand(String command, TextField textfield)` - Adds a successful command to the command history,
and clears the TextField
- `CommandRetriever#getPreviousCommand(TextField textfield)` - Displays the previous command in the Textfield, if it
exists in the history
- `CommandRetriever#getNextCommand(TextField textfield)` - Displays the next command in the Textfield, if it
exists in the history

These methods are called by `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` and `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased(KeyEvent e)`. 

Here is the UML diagram for `CommandRetriever`.

![CommandRetrieverClassDiagram](images/CommandRetrieverClassDiagram.png)

`CommandRetriever` only keeps track of the commands executed successfully, as invalid commands are highlighted red
and do not disappear from the TextField. Thus, there is no need to store these invalid commands since the user can
already edit the invalid command in the current implementation without having to retype it. Storing invalid commands
in `CommandRetriever` would only clutter up the history, especially if the user inputted numerous invalid commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the arrow key changes the `CommandBox` text field at each step.
A sequence diagram is also provided below.

![CommandRetrieverSequenceDiagram](images/CommandRetrieverSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `commandHistory` is initialised as an empty 
`ArrayList<String>`, and index is initialised as 0.

Step 2. The user executes a command, `listbuyers` by pressing the Enter key. `CommandBox#handleCommand` is fired,
getting the text from the text field. Since it is a valid command, it is executed successfully. `listbuyers` is added
to the `commandHistory` list, and index is set to `commandHistory.size()`.

Step 3. The user types a command halfway, but does not press the Enter key. He/she now wishes to use the previous
command to type the command.

Step 4. The user presses and releases the Up arrow. `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased` is fired, which sets the text field
to display the `(index - 1)`th element in `commmandHistory`. Because the current command is one that has not been
executed, it is saved in the field `currentCommand`.

Step 5. The user presses and releases the Up arrow again. `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased` is fired, but since there are
no more previous commands, nothing happens.

Step 6. The user presses and releases the Down arrow. `CommandBox#handleKeyReleased` is fired. Since this is the last
element in `commandHistory`, the text field is set to display the string `currentCommand`. This would be the user's unexecuted
command from Step 3.

### Creating a buyer

The `Person` class represents a buyer with buyer-specific fields. `Price Range`, `Characteristics`, and `Priority` denote his budget, requirements for the property, and buyer priority respectively. 

These three fields are all optional. When the user chooses not to indicate a buyer’s price range or desired characteristics, the `priceRange` and `desiredCharacteristics` field of a buyer may be null. Hence, they have both been implemented using `Optional<T>`. 
When the user chooses not to indicate a buyer priority, the buyer's priority will be set to the default priority as `NORMAL`.

This is the class diagram of a `Person`. 

![PersonClassDiagram](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

The structure for executing an `addbuyer` command follows the flow as mentioned in the “Logic component” section of this guide. 

Design considerations: 
No duplicate buyers can be added to the buyer list. This means that no two buyers with the same name can exist. We considered using not only name but also contact number to identify a buyer, so that two people with the same name but different contact numbers can be added. However, we decided against it as users likely differentiate their contacts by name and would not want to save a duplicated name contact, hence the current implementation would serve as a needed warning of a duplicated name attempt to the user. 

### Creating a property

The `Property` class represents a property with property-specific fields. `Price` and `Characteristics` denote the price and feature of the property respectively.

The `price` field is mandatory while the `characteristics` field is optional. When the user chooses not to indicate a property's characteristics, the `characteristics` field of a property may be null. Hence, it has been implemented using `Optional<T>`.

This is the class diagram of a `Property`.

![PropertyClassDiagram](images/PropertyClassDiagram.png)

The structure for executing an `addprop` command follows the flow as mentioned in the "Logic component" section of this guide.

Design considerations:
No duplicate properties can be added to the property list. This means that no two properties with the same name and price can exist. We considered using only name to identify a property, but later decided against it since in real life different units under the same property name can be listed at the same time. In the future, we might allow two properties with same name and price but different characteristics to be added to the property list because this can also be a possible scenario in real life.

### Owner specification within a property

To identify the owner of the property, we decided to include an `Owner` object within a `Property`. This `Owner` class contains two fields: `name` and `phone`.

The `name` and `phone` fields in the `Owner` class are compulsory, to make sure that each property being sold has a relevant contact buyer.
The fields are also validated the same way as when creating a new `Buyer` object.

To support retrieving the `Owner` of a `Property`, we added the following methods:
- `Property#getOwner()` - Returns the `Owner` object of the property.
- `Property#getOwnerName()` - Retrieves the name of the owner of the property.
- `Property#getOwnerPhone()` - Retrieves the phone number of the owner of the property.

This is the class diagram showing the full `Property` class diagram, with the `Owner` class included:
![FullPropertyClassDiagram](images/FullPropertyClassDiagram.png)

The `Owner` class enacts the Composition relationship, as the `Property` class contains the `Owner` object. Hence, if the property is deleted, it's associated owner will also be deleted. 
The tradeoffs for this approach is examined below:

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the owner class associates with the property class:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Owner class is coupled together with the property class.
    * Pros:
      * The `Owner` class is only used in the `Property` class, so it makes sense to couple them together.
      * You do not need to create an owner object separately using another command.
      * This reduces complexity of the system, and unexpected behaviours.
    * Cons: 
      * This creates a 1-to-1 relationship between the owner and the property.
      * Each owner is coupled tightly with the property, and cannot be used for other properties.

* **Alternative 2:** Users will have to create an `Owner` object separately, and link it to the property manually.
    * Pros:
      * This allows for a many-to-many relationship between the owners and properties.
      * This allows for better OOP design, as owners will be treated as a separate, first-class entity, similar to `Buyer`.
    * Cons:
      * Increases complexity for a possibly limited use case of linking an owner to multiple properties.
      * This may lead to unexpected behaviours, such as whether properties linked to an owner should be deleted when the owner is deleted.

### Filtering properties by price range

The `Properties` list is filtered using a predicate, `filterPropsByPricePredicate`. This predicate checks if the property's price falls within a specified price range. 

The structure for executing a `filterprops` command follows the flow as mentioned in the “Logic component” section of this guide. 

Design considerations: 
As `Property` has a single specific `Price`, it is much less useful to filter the list using one price value as it is unlikely to match any property. Instead, we decided to filter by a price range instead, where any property whose price falls within this range would be displayed.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* property agent
* needs to manage a significant number of buyers, sellers and properties concurrently
* often overwhelmed by a disorganised and inefficient database
* wants to keep track of all information neatly categorised in one place
* takes too long to manually go through each property to find one that matches a buyer's requirements
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: increases efficiency and convenience by allowing quick text-based inputs, separate functionalities for two contact bases (buyers and sellers) and properties, and optimized searching and filtering to automate property to buyer matches
